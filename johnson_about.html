	<p class="aboutme">As a Harrisburg Area Community College Graduate, Rebekah Johnson is looking forward to entering the workforce.

	<p class="aboutme">She has worked at her local Sheetz for three years. She enjoyed working with her coworkers to create a clean and fully-stocked environment for full customer satisfaction.
She has been described as an excellent team player. Through her experience as a third shift supervisor, She learned the importance of communication, a positive attitude, and keeping a cool head. Running a store taught her to come up with creative solutions to problems that may arise during a shift. It also was a good lesson in balancing and managing workloads. She attended college and balanced a third shift supervisor job, and elected to demote in order to focus on her last year of college. She has worked both first and third shift as a regular employee.

	<p class="aboutme">I graduated New Oxford High School in 2018. My favorite classes and activities were drafting, 3d art, computer programming, and music, particularly the yearly musicals. 
I worked with autocad, and also built floorplans and building designs. When I went to HACC i took an architecture class with John Boecker. It was more design oriented, and I feel I learned a new aspect of architecture i hadnt thought of before. While I had a lot of fun, unfortunately I did not feel it was the path for me.

	<p class="aboutme">In 3d art I learned how to make all sorts of things in all sorts of mediums. As a freshman, I entered the class early on recommendation from the middle school art teacher, and met a senior who took me under her wing. She helped me get acquainted with more traditional art concepts, and we helped each other with each of our projects. I continued to the next class, and learned how to make more things. I took a 3d art class at HACC as well, and I enjoyed it, although I struggled sometimes with reaching outside of the box. </p>

	<p class="aboutme">	However, at the end I felt most accomplished when I was praised by the professor for understanding the final bonus assignment. We were to make art that gelled with nature, while not completely disturbing it. He showed us a video of someone who piled driftwood into an igloo-like structure, and watched as the tides came in and pulled it all back out. People made things like wreaths and painted on leaves, or put rocks in their backyards. I did something I thought was unusual, and took helicopter seeds from under an oak tree, and found a spot of soil with cracks in the ground. I put the seeds in the ground, so the wings were above the soil, but the seed planted below. I took photos on the ground, as if the wings were trees. I also took one from standing level, displaying how unassuming it was from a normal human's vision. At the time I wasn't sure of myself, but I was reassured when the professor was excited to see my unusual piece.

	<p class="aboutme">In high school programming, we learned java and javascript. I enjoyed this class a lot, and sped ahead of my classmates, although I did take it a year later than everyone else starting out (same as my spanish classes). I built a lot of complex things in the programs we were using (detailed animations in ALICE, I built an entire treasure planet ship in a browser).

	<p class="aboutme">I participated in every musical in high school and county choir, and learned a lot about the dedication to a project and the subsequent pride of presenting my hard work. I was responsible for balancing homework and practice. I had leading roles in my last two musical performances, and the latter was surprising, as no other senior had gotten a lead role and I was able to work hard and put in the time. I also adapted to a whole new team, as newcomers came in and seniors graduated, I acted as a smiling face and ambassador. I was awarded the most improved in my grade by my choir teacher, and was part of the choir council. I also did women's choir and indoor percussion my last year.
